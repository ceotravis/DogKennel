# Dog Racing Simulator

## Overview

Welcome to the Dog Racing Simulator, a console-based application that simulates exciting races between dogs in a kennel. In this simulator, you can select two dogs from a list, and they will compete in a running race. The winner is determined based on factors such as stamina, chonkiness, size, and gender-related traits. The simulation introduces randomness for tie-breaking scenarios, making each race unique.

## Notes

- The simulator uses a point system to determine the winner, with each factor contributing to the points.
- Randomness is introduced in tie-breaking scenarios to add an element of unpredictability.
